# Social-Network-Visualizer
Java application for loading information pertaining to social network and visualizing information. Front-end implemented with JavaFX.

The current version of this project was submitted as class project for UW-Madison CS 400. This was a group project and represents the 
cumulative efforts of myself and three other students. Because I intend to add functionality and make changes as I see fit, I have,
with the permission of my teammates, uploaded this project as a personal repository here.
